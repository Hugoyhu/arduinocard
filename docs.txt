Getting started!

This follows the Arduino UNO format. It has a 328P core.

You must flash on Optiboot onto your 328P.

This board is compatible with Atmega8, Atmega168, and Atmega328/328P.

3.3V output is NOT SUPPORTED.

USB bridge is not onboard. You must use a FTDI adapter.

Once you've burned Optiboot onto the 328P, connected to your computer, you may now use Arduino IDE and be able to program this board like an arduino UNO.
